The aim of this homework is to know how perceptrons and neural networks work better, I'm going to report what I did <br/>
step by step <br/>

#### 1. Scattering data
First of all I want to scatter the data and show each group with a different color. <br/>
This is what I got<br/>
![](Figures/Figure_1.png)<br/>
red color is used to show label 1 and blue is used to show 0<br/>

#### 2. Splitting data
Then I splitted the data as 80% training and 20% test data

#### 3. Perceptron
In this part I want to implement a single perceptron, the cost function, the derivatives and the activation function I<br/>
used are shown below <br/>

#### 4. Train neural network
Now the perceptron is trained by training data and then tested, the important thing to do in this part is to give <br/>
appropriate number of epochs and learning rate to perceptron
